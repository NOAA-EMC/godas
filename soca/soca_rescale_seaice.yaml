# TODO Set the rescaling in exp.config. Empirical values, will need to be adjusted by user at some point.
rescale:

  alpha_max: 2.0    # Max background rescaling
  minval: 1.0e-2     # Only apply the analysis if the background fraction
                     # is more than minval
  restore_clim: 0    # restore to clim sea-ice thickness; 1:on; 0:off; default is off
