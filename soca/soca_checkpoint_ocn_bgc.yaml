  chl_max:     20.0      # Maximum chl analysis (checkpoints after maxfac and minfac are applied)
  chl_min:    0.001      # Mininum chl analysis (checkpoints after maxfac and minfac are applied)
  po4_max:     3.0e-6    # Maximum po4 analysis (checkpoints after maxfac and minfac are applied)
  irr_mix_min: 1.0       # Only apply the analysis for po4 where irr_mix is greater than this value
  maxfac:      2.0       # maximum analysis value is set to be maxfac * bkg value
  minfac:      0.5       # mininum analysis value is set to be minfac * bkg value
